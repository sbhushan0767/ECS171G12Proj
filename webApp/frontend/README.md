# Styling

For this project, we should use a styling library called Styled-Components. I think this would be best since it makes it a lot easier to style third party stlying libraries like BootStrap, Material-UI and Ant Design.

For the styling library, I think Ant Design would be best since it contains a lot of the components that we need to make the project look pretty good.

I'm open to change if anybody has any input on the decisions above :)

# What still needs to be done

NOTE: When adding components, it would be easier to find a component onf Ant Design, https://ant.design/components/overview/ and edit since it would save a lot of time.
