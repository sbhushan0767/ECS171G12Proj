# Styling

Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/Sdgy27iyKMiXrx2I3rg4EQ/ECS-171?node-id=0%3A1

For this project, we should use a styling library called Styled-Components. I think this would be best since it makes it a lot easier to style third party stlying libraries like BootStrap, Material-UI and Ant Design.

For the styling library, I think Ant Design would be best since it contains a lot of the components that we need to make the project look pretty good.

I'm open to change if anybody has any input on the decisions above :)

# Backend

## Setting up Python environment

`cd` into the backend folder and run the following command:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

That will set up your python enviornment for the project

Afterwards running the following commands ONCE:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=main.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

## Running the application

Finally you can run the backend on localhost:5000 with:

```bash
flask run
```

Alternatively you can run:

```
python3 main.py
```
